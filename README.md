# Authentication
A simple practice over Spring Boot's authentication mechanism.
I preferred to implement this project step by step, in two version **for now** !

versions :
* v1(version 1) : I just used tables, without any authentication!
* v2(version 2) : Here i used [Basic access authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication), with a slight change in tables.
