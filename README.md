# Authentication
A simple practice over Spring Boot's authentication mechanism.
I preferred to implement this project step by step, in two version **for now** !

versions :
* v1 : I just used tables, without any authentication!
* v2 : Here i used [Basic access authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication), with a slight change in tables.
* v3 : **under dvelopmen**. i planed to use jwt authentication with a keycloak server, you may get it soon, patience!
